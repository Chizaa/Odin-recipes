<p>Fried rice is another of my favorite Nigerian food. I like it because it contains lots of healthy ingredients and it's quite easy to prepare.</p>
<p> Most people prepare this food only during a special occassion because it can be quiet expensive especially if you want to add all the major ingredients that makes this meal mouth irrestitible.</p>
